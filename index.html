        Dear Baby Grace,
        As we celebrate another year of love and togetherness, I want to take a moment to reflect on the beautiful journey we’ve shared. From the first moment we met, I knew there was something truly special about you. Over the years, you have filled my life with so much joy, laughter, and unconditional love.
        Every day with you is a blessing, and I cherish every moment we spend together. You are not just my partner, but my best friend, my confidant, and my greatest support. Through all the ups and downs, our love has only grown stronger, and I am grateful for every experience we’ve shared.
        I look forward to many more years of creating wonderful memories, facing challenges hand in hand, and continuing to grow together. Thank you for being the amazing person you are and for making our life together so incredibly beautiful.
        Happy Anniversary, my love! Here’s to many more years of happiness, love, and adventure. With all my love,
        <br><br>bebe mo hihi</i></b></p>
